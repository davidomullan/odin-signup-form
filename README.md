# Odin Signup Form
This project is intended to give you a chance to flex some of the new items you’ve been absorbing over the past few lessons. This time it’s a sign-up form for an imaginary service.

Developer: [David O'Mullan](https://github.com/davidomullan)
Guidelines: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)

# Implementation
TBD
